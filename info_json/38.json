  "issue_description": "The `text\\split-batch.yaml` fails with 25 pixel difference, and the `image\\tile-repeat-prim-or-decompose.yaml` crashes, because we run out of descriptors. The fail was introduced in https://github.com/szeged/webrender/commit/1e81eaf8fa8ddbed1f8beda20a18bfc8787c7e80, where we started using the `max_image_array_layers` limit from gfx-hal. Previously we had a constant `2048` value there. This only affects the Vulkan backend. ",
