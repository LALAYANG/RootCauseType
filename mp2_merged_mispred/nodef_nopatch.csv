"30","Async wait","I/O","OS","","","","We currently use `package.json` for our configuration. I think we should move away from using `package.json` and use something like `next.config.js` since it gives us more power than JSON.    An example is the issue for custom Webpack support: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/40.  With a config like this you could do this for example:    ```js  // next.config.js    export default {    webpack: (webpackConfig) => {      const newConfig = { ...webpackConfig };      newConfig.module.preloaders.push({ test: /\.js$/, loader: 'eslint-loader' });      return newConfig;    },    cdn: false  }  ```    Which is in my opinion better than creating a new file for webpack since this is more centralised. This does however still give users the option to use different files, for the webpack example:    ```js  // next.config.js    export default {    webpack: require('./webpack').default,    cdn: false  }  ```    These are just my thoughts, I found out that I needed a sort of config file in `.js` when starting a PR for this project. Very curious what others think of this 😄."

"68","Network","Async wait","Async wait","","","","## Summary    This is my guess as to the source of the resolver flake, based on information and extensive debugging from @zanieb. In short, if we rely on `self.index.packages` as a source of truth during error reporting, we open ourselves up to a source of non-determinism, because we fetch package metadata asynchronously in the background while we solve -- so packages _could_ be included in or excluded from the index depending on the order in which those requests are returned.    So, instead, we now track the set of packages that _were_ visited by the solver. Visiting a package _requires_ that we wait for its metadata to be available. By limiting analysis to those packages that were visited during solving, we are faithfully representing the state of the solver at the time of failure.    Closes #863"

"127","Concurrency","Unordered collections","Unordered collections","","","","The test `Win32ProgramRepositoryMustCallOnAppRenamedForLnkAppsWhenRenamedEventIsRaised` was experiencing random failures due to object identity mismatches in the repository's hash-based storage system.    ## Root Cause    The test was manually creating `Win32Program` objects:    ```csharp  Win32Program olditem = new Win32Program  {      Name = ""oldpath"",      ExecutableName = oldpath,      FullPath = linkingTo,  };  ```    However, the `DoOnAppRenamedAsync` method creates the `oldApp` object for removal using a different approach for .lnk files:    ```csharp  oldApp = new Win32Program() {       Name = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(e.OldName),       ExecutableName = Path.GetFileName(e.OldName),       FullPath = newApp?.FullPath ?? oldPath   };  ```    Since the repository uses `GetHashCode()` (based on `Name`, `ExecutableName`, and `FullPath`) to identify objects for removal, any subtle differences in these properties would cause the `Remove()` operation to fail, leading to test assertion failures.    ## Fix    Changed the test to use `Win32Program.GetAppFromPath()` instead of manual object creation:    ```csharp  Win32Program olditem = Win32Program.GetAppFromPath(oldFullPath);  Win32Program newitem = Win32Program.GetAppFromPath(newFullPath);  ```    This mirrors the approach used in the working `Win32ProgramRepositoryMustCallOnAppRenamedForUrlAppsWhenRenamedEventIsRaised` test and ensures that test objects are created using the same code path as the production code, eliminating hash code mismatches.    ## Why This Was Random    The test failure appeared random because it depended on subtle differences in object creation that could vary based on timing, mock setup, or other environmental factors. By using the same object creation method as the production code, the test becomes deterministic."

Simplify org.apache.spark.sql.connect.execution.ReattachableExecuteSuite.""reattach after connection expired"" to make it more deterministic.    ### Why are the changes needed?    The test previously involved execution and interruption that made the test unnecessarily flaky, e.g., an exception was thrown when releasing the corresponding [execution](https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12296721038/job/34316344940), not when reattaching the execution.  - The test's sole purpose is to check whether the lack of 'session' results in the correct error code.  - The involvement of actual query execution only makes the test flaky and complicated.    ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?

"153","Time","Async wait","Resource leak","","","","**What type of PR is this?**    /kind bug    **What this PR does / why we need it**:    Pod with PVC will not be scheduled if the PVC is being deleted.  This can happen when the PVC has finalizers of storage plugins.    Such a pod becomes pending.  Unfortunately, after the finalizer  finishes and PVC is deleted, the pod remains pending forever.  The StatefulSet controller does nothing for this pending pod.    This commit prevents the StatefulSet controller from creating  such pods when PVC is to be deleted.    Reprocedure:    1. Create a single node cluster with [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind).  2. Create a StatefulSet with the following manifests:    ```yaml  apiVersion: v1  kind: Service  metadata:    name: test    namespace: default  spec:    clusterIP: None    selector:      app: test  ---  apiVersion: apps/v1  kind: StatefulSet  metadata:    name: test    namespace: default  spec:    replicas: 1    selector:      matchLabels:        app: test    serviceName: test    template:      metadata:        labels:          app: test      spec:        containers:        - command:          - pause          image: quay.io/cybozu/ubuntu:18.04          name: ubuntu          volumeMounts:          - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html            name: www    volumeClaimTemplates:    - metadata:        name: www      spec:        accessModes:        - ReadWriteOnce        resources:          requests:            storage: 1Gi        volumeMode: Filesystem  ```    3. Once the pod gets running, edit PVC to add a finalizer `aaa.bbb/ccc`.  4. Run `kubectl delete --wait=false pvc/www-test-0`.  5. Run `kubectl delete --wait=false pods/test-0`.  6. See a new pod is created and become pending.  7. Edit the PVC to remove the `aaa.bbb/ccc` finalizer.  8. See the PVC is get deleted.  9. See the Pod remains pending forever.    **Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**:  ```release-note  Adding fix to statefulset controller to wait for pvc deletion before creating pods.  ```"

"204","Async wait","Async wait","Network","","","","When you have a rewrite in middleware like this:  ```ts  return NextResponse.rewrite(u, {    status: 403,  });  ```  The rewrite status code is not propogated to the cache interceptor's responses when you have an external middleware.     We can also safely remove the `x-next-cache-tags` header on the response.    I did update some tests that were flakey aswell. We need to register the event listener before the navigation."
"206","Time","Network","Network","","","","Fixes #145 -  the issue was caused by the slightly variable results returned by the GitHub API.    In all the tests in `FunctionalSpec`, we create several test fixtures with the GitHub API, each created to be used once and thrown away:    * A brand-new GitHub repository, populated with whatever Git history we require  * A brand new PR in the repository, which we also merge    Before continuing on to the next step, which would be having Prout scan the repo for recently-merged PRs, we perform several checks to ensure that the GitHub API confirms the status of the merged PR:    https://github.com/guardian/prout/blob/a710e347afb94ca719e11b9c5b6b3312f1245e98/test/lib/Helpers.scala#L180-L195    However, looking a the differing logs produced by the failure & success cases in #145, it became apparent that even though we've checked the GitHub API."

"212","Test order dependency","Async wait","Time","","","","Fixes #2495: **Kubelet doesn't kill old pods when BoundPods is empty**  The first time kubelet starts, while there are no updates, `kl.pods` is `nil` ([pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L1118](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L1118)):  ``` GO case <-time.After(kl.resyncInterval):     glog.V(4).Infof(""Periodic sync"")     if kl.pods == nil {         continue     } ```  which guarantees that [`syncPods(...)`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L992), which contains the container killing logic is never called.  So the first part of the fix is to remove this check and allow `syncPods(...)` to be called even when nil, so that the first periodic sync can clean up old containers.  However, this isn't enough because inside `syncPods(...)` there is a check to make sure that all sources have been ""seen"" before it will kill old containers ([pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L1026](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L1026)):  ``` GO if !kl.sourcesReady() {     // If the sources aren't ready, skip deletion, as we may accidentally delete pods     // for sources that haven't reported yet.     glog.V(4).Infof(""Skipping deletes, sources aren't ready yet."")     return nil } ```  This check is performed in the [`SeenAllSources()`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/config/config.go#L87) function, and is `true` only if a `SET` update has been seen for all registered kubelet sources.  However, no `SET` update is emitted by any of the sources until they successfully read a value, which means the original problem still exists.  So the second part of the fix is to have the kubelet boundpod sources (etcd, file, and http) all emit a `SET` update with an empty pod list when the source is first read but no value exists; the empty update will not make it back to the kubelet sync loop because it will be filtered out by the [update merge logic](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/config/config.go#L140); but it will cause the source to be [marked as seen](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/config/config.go#L238) so the periodic sync (enabled by the first fix) will clean up the old containers (since all sources will now be marked as seen after the first read attempt)."
"223","Async wait","Test order dependency","Test order dependency","","","","Thanks for Diana Carroll to report this issue (https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1100)  the current saveAsTextFile/SequenceFile will overwrite the output directory silently if the directory already exists, this behaviour is not desirable because  overwriting the data silently is not user-friendly  if the partition number of two writing operation changed, then the output directory will contain the results generated by two runnings  My fix includes:  add some new APIs with a flag for users to define whether he/she wants to overwrite the directory: if the flag is set to true, then the output directory is deleted first and then written into the new data to prevent the output directory contains results from multiple rounds of running;  if the flag is set to false, Spark will throw an exception if the output directory already exists  changed JavaAPI part  default behaviour is overwriting  Two questions  should we deprecate the old APIs without such a flag?  I noticed that Spark Streaming also called these APIs, I thought we don't need to change the related part in streaming? @tdas"

"312","Concurrency","Async wait","Async wait","","","","### What changes were proposed in this pull request?  This PR aims to fix flaky tests in `SparkConnectServiceSuite` which are caused by `executorHolder` [undefined](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ab9a63626018156b3e0f267f14409c30031692b7/sql/connect/server/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/SparkConnectServiceSuite.scala#L908).  The conditions to reproduce this issue are:    (1) The operation finishes before its `executeHolder` is set in [MockSparkListener#onOtherEvent](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ab9a63626018156b3e0f267f14409c30031692b7/sql/connect/server/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/SparkConnectServiceSuite.scala#L961).  (2) `executeHolder` is accessed through calling `verifyEvents.onComplete` after the operation finishes.     `SparkListenerConnectOperationStarted` is posted asynchronously with the corresponding operation so the condition (1) can be met. After an operation finishes, `executeHolder` is [removed from a map](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/af16aa8e11c223642f928b0b9893854a851d70bb/sql/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SparkConnectExecutionManager.scala#L153) so if the condition (1) is met, `executeHolder` is never set because `SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder` consistently returns `None`.    One example of the test affected by this issue is `SPARK-43923: commands send events - get_resources_command`.  You can easily reproduce this issue by inserting sleep into `MockSparkListener#onOtherEvent` like as follows.    ```     val executeKey =       ExecuteKey(sessionHolder.userId, sessionHolder.sessionId, e.operationId)  +  Thread.sleep(1000)     executeHolder = SparkConnectService.executionManager.getExecuteHolder(executeKey)  ```    And then, run test.  ```  $ build/sbt 'connect/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.connect.planner.SparkConnectServiceSuite -- -z ""get_resources_command""'  ```  To resolve this issue, this PR proposes:    * Change `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` just to assert `executeHolder.eventsManager.getProducedRowCount == producedRowCount`  * Call `VerifyEvents#onCompleted` from `StreamObserver#onCompleted`  * Add `VerifyEvents#assertClosed` to check if the status is `Closed`    ### Why are the changes needed?  For test stability.    ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?  No.    ### How was this patch tested?  Inserting `Thread.sleep(1000)` like mentioned above and then run `SparkConnectServiceSuite`.    ### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?  No."

"338","Concurrency","Async wait","Async wait","","","","This PR implements the Fullscreen API.     The final commit also adds some Qt UI (an ""exit fullscreen"" button that animates from the top down, sort of like how Chrome does it, and also Firefox). For Qt-backends, the escape key also exits out of fullscreen, fully.    The spec can be found [here](https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/).    New web platform test results (fullscreen/api) with this patch series applied:    ```  Ran 57 tests finished in 13.7 seconds.    • 36 ran as expected. 0 tests skipped.    • 1 tests had errors unexpectedly    • 1 tests timed out unexpectedly    • 21 tests had unexpected subtest results  ```  (up from 0 expected to 36. Another test succeeds when #4329 is applied)    Additional work that needs to happen:  - https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-fullscreenenabled needs to be implemented fully, where a document's ""allowed to use"" can be deterimined by the `allowFullscreen` attribute set on an iframe. This attribute can not be changed dynamically and once set for a document, is set for the rest of it's life time.    Additional work that's required can be determined by the WPT suite."
"340","Unordered collections","Unordered collections","Test order dependency","","","","I am aware of a case where the same set of plugins would lead to one controller starting successfully and one controller failing to start, depending on the order in which the plugins were listed. We currently use file system iteration order, which is undefined. This PR sorts the list by filename before passing the result to the topological sorting function, so every controller with the same set of plugins will now load them in the same order. This should make it easier to debug such problems, because they will either always occur, or they will never occur — but at least the behavior will be deterministic.    ### Testing done    I added a log statement to print the list of active plugins as consumed by the `UberClassLoader` and verified that at each level of the topological sort the entries were in lexicographical order.    ### Proposed changelog entries    List plugins in deterministic order to improve diagnosability of plugin linkage errors.    ### Proposed upgrade guidelines    N/A    ```[tasklist]  ### Submitter checklist  - [ ] The Jira issue, if it exists, is well-described.  - [ ] The changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developers, depending on the change) and are in the imperative mood (see [examples](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/content/_data/changelogs/weekly.yml)). Fill in the **Proposed upgrade guidelines** section only if there are breaking changes or changes that may require extra steps from users during upgrade.  - [ ] There is automated testing or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.  - [ ] New public classes, fields, and methods are annotated with `@Restricted` or have `@since TODO` Javadocs, as appropriate.  - [ ] New deprecations are annotated with `@Deprecated(since = ""TODO"")` or `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true, since = ""TODO"")`, if applicable.  - [ ] New or substantially changed JavaScript is not defined inline and does not call `eval` to ease future introduction of Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (see [documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/csp/)).  - [ ] For dependency updates, there are links to external changelogs and, if possible, full differentials.  - [ ] For new APIs and extension points, there is a link to at least one consumer.  ```    ### Desired reviewers    @mention    <!-- Comment:  If you need an accelerated review process by the community (e.g., for critical bugs), mention @jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers.  -->    Before the changes are marked as `ready-for-merge`:    ```[tasklist]  ### Maintainer checklist  - [ ] There are at least two (2) approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.  - [ ] Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.  - [ ] Changelog entries in the pull request title and/or **Proposed changelog entries** are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.  - [ ] Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.  - [ ] If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the `upgrade-guide-needed` label is set and there is a **Proposed upgrade guidelines** section in the pull request title (see [example](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4387)).  - [ ] If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a _Bug_ or _Improvement_, and be labeled as `lts-candidate` to be considered (see [query](https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?filter=12146)).  ```    <a href=""https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/8453""><img src=""https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg""/></a>"

"344","Concurrency","Concurrency","Async wait","","","","As documented in #33323, we have frequent failures of the flaky triggerer job tests.    The flaky failures are about some errors when we close all the sessions in teardown of the test. It turns out that the tests had side-effect - they have not waited for the TriggererJob thread to complete, they merely marked them to be stopped, but they have not waited for those to complete - this is quite plausible explanation of the flaky test failures - since those threads have 1 second sleep, it's more than likely that the session has been created and used by the thread while the teardown has been attempting to close all the sessions.    This side effect could also have an effect for other tests that were run after - because in a busy test run machine, the side effects could propagate further than just to the teardown, so it could also explain why sometimes (very rarely) other job tests failed with similar errors.    The fix is to join the runner after marking it to be stopped.    Fixes: #33323 (Hopefully)    <!--   Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one   or more contributor license agreements.

"394","Async wait","Time","Resource leak","","","","Refs #56190    This PR does two things in the specific `test` case that is flaky:    - Make the `composedSignal` a weak ref so the test won't hold any reference that could keep that variable from being GCed.  - Add `gcUntil` so it will make more calls to `global.gc`. Precisely, until that condition is reached or a maximum number of attempts is hit."

"415","Async wait","Async wait","Time","","","","# Description  Fixes 3 flaky tests.    # Changes  - `local_node_store_filtered_solutions`      - it failed due to timeouts => increased the http delay buffer to give a bit of wiggle room      - sometimes an auction ran while only 1 of the 2 solutions was included => configure hardcoded solver solutions after both orders have been included in the auction  - `local_node_partially_fillable_pool`      - solver got deny listed because it failed to produce a working solution for some reason          - updated the flags to enable that feature to work like `--flag=true` instead of `--flag` (to enable)          - disabled the feature on all tests except tests specifically for those features  - `local_node_replace_order`      - order got settled before it could be replaced          - ban solver until the original order is no longer inside the auction          - allow unverified quotes for that test due to the banned solver account    ## How to test  used the flaky test runner  - ran all local node tests for 2h -> ~30 successful executions  - `local_node_replace_order` -> flaky test [job](https://github.com/cowprotocol/services/actions/runs/17316920910/job/49161443945) with 369 successful runs"

"431","Async wait","Concurrency","Network","","","","There's a TOCTOU issue that can happen when selecting unused ports for the server to use (we get assigned an unused port by the OS, and between then and when the server actually binds to the port another test steals it). Improve this by checking if the server existed soon after setup, and if so we retry starting it. Client connection can also fail spuriously (in local testing) so added a retry mechanism.    This also fixes a hang, where if the server exited (almost always due to the issue described above) before we connected to it, attempting to connect our client ZMQ sockets to it would just hang. To resolve this, I added a timeout so we can't wait forever."
